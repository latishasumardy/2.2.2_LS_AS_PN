Description:
This assignment was a lesson in integrating Backendless features into an Android Studio app as a remote database. This included creating new users and using data tables to control and look at user information.

Team member roles in assignment: Code completed by Latisha. Summaries and questions done by Arina, Latisha, and Priyanka.

Key Lessons learned:

Part 1: We learned how to modify apps in Android Studio to achieve data persistence by utilising Backendless features to store and retrieve data. We also looked at the importance of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes.

Part 2: We learned more about data persistence, which we understood more through creating a new abstract class which would keep shared data between the applicant and the guardian together.

Part 3: We learned about the dangers of utilising the cloud, as we could come across a lot of different security risks. We would still use the cloud because it is extremely convenient, but there is still a risk of the information getting hacked or stolen.

Conclusion Questions
1)  What are the benefits of adding a back end for an application?

Benefits of a back end would allow more accessibility, and provides a variety of outcomes from one model. There is less complications on the app development, less overall time spent, and a larger accessibility to different platforms.


2) What is a Backend as a Service and how does it work? Include as much detail as you can about the infrastructure and implementation.  Include any interesting notes from class presentations.

A backend as a service is a model for providing web app and mobile development to form applications while still having the same features of a user management. Backend as a service also provides cloud storage, push notifications, server codes, user and file management, social networking, and location services.
